/* Caveats:
 * - JSON "null" values are represented as lightuserdata since Lua
 *   tables cannot contain "nil". Compare with cjson.null.
 * - Invalid UTF-8 characters are not detected and will be passed
 *   untouched. If required, UTF-8 error checking should be done
 *   outside this library.
 * - Javascript comments are not part of the JSON spec, and are not
 *   currently supported.
 *
 * Note: Decoding is slower than encoding. Lua spends significant
 *       time (30%) managing tables when parsing JSON since it is
 *       difficult to know object/array sizes ahead of time.
